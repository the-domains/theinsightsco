_"Because every time innovation changes the world,  
it all started with an insight"._

## What is an insight?

According to _Vriens and Verhulst_, an insight is:

_"A thought, fact, combination of facts, data and/or analysis of data  
that induces meaning and furthers understanding of a situation or issue  
that has the potential of benefiting the business or re-directing the thinking  
about that situation or issue which then in turn has the potential  
of benefiting the business"_.

## Why us?

Because we, at The Insights Co.  
have the knowledge, experience and tools  
to capture, process and leverage
