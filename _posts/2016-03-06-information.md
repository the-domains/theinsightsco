_"Because every time innovation changes the world,  
it all started with an insight"._

## What is an insight?

According to _Vriens and Verhulst_, an insight is:

> A thought, fact, combination of facts, data and/or analysis of data that induces meaning and furthers understanding of a situation or issue that has the potential of benefiting the business or re-directing the thinking about that situation or issue which then in turn has the potential of benefiting the business.
